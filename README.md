# EnviroPlusWeb

This Fork:
- Changed the drop-down menu into radio buttons for touchscreen convenience.
- Changed the Keys on the bottom of the page to bold text (temp, humi, pres, etc).
- Adapted the Max / Min values of each key for indoor use.
- Removed the time/date, css and favicon from the interface.
